		<p>Donations help run Comix Club. By donating, you recognize that all the money
			will be used to pay for hosting and services.</p>
			<h4>Where does the money go?</h4>
			<p>
				The money goes towards paying for our domain ($10.88/year), our host ($9.88/month),
				and UserApp.io (soon to be $99/month). Any money not used will split between a charity fund
				and a reserve. The costs add up to about $108.88/month, plus $10.88 a year.
			</p>
			<h4>So you don't get any of the money?</h4>
			<p>
				Absolutely not. It all goes back into Comix Club to make it more awesome. This could
				possibly change in the future but this is how it is for now. Comix Club is not my full-time
				job.
